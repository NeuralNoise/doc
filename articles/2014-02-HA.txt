High Availability on Zentyal
----------------------------

High Availability (HA) is the next step once you have a server running
smoothly. Taking into account that hardware fails, communications fail
and virtualisation tools fail as well, we have to have the tools to deal with.

Think of having a Zentyal server acting as the gateway of your
organisation, which also integrates a VPN server to access remotely. You may
require to have a backup server with the same configuration to use in
case of failure. The downtime our users will notice will be minimal or
none. This is called Active/Passive configuration.

The first step in the new High Availability module for Zentyal is to
provide users an Active/Passive redundancy configuration for our
gateway and infrastructure modules such as firewall, DNS, VPN, DHCP or
network routing.

To be more exact, here you have the first set of features on the next
release:

 * Multi-node active/passive redundancy configuration
 * Configuration replication among nodes
 * Floating IP address management
 * Select a node as active (Promote) or passive (Demote)
 * Cluster status
 * Different transport protocols for cluster membership (unicast vs
   multicast)

Set up a cluster
----------------

You want to set up two Zentyal Servers (version 3.4) to be the gateway of
your office. Therefore you are setting up cluster of two nodes.

Firstly, you have to create the cluster in the one of the hosts going
to "System --> High availability". Update the network interface you
are going to use as mean of communication between the nodes on your
cluster, then enable the module and, finally, save changes.

Once you have created the cluster, a different page with the status of
your cluster displaying the list of registered nodes and a cluster
secret.

Go to the second node, at "High Availability" menu, choose "join to an
existing cluster" option. You must set the first node IP address, the
web administrator port where the web administration interface is
listening to and the autogenerated cluster secret. Make sure you
choose the right network interface to reach the former node. Once you
have set it up, save changes.

Add a floating IP address
-------------------------

As you see above, you have now two nodes in your cluster. As there is
no configured resources in your cluster, there is no active
node. Let's go to set up your gateway IP address, that IP address will
be shared in your cluster to provide redundancy in your Internet
connection. Your clients shall use that IP address as default
resilient gateway.

<Floating IP address>

In the Cluster status tab, you can see where the floating IP address
(known as resource) will be running.

<Resource running>

That's all you need to have two nodes in high availabitlity.

Underlying tools
----------------

We use pacemaker [1] as the cluster resource manager. It is in charge of
managing the resources and fencing nodes having corosync [2] as
stack. This means the cluster membership, messages and quorum is done
by this tool.

As Zentyal Server 3.4 is based on Ubuntu Saucy 13.10, we are sure we
are using latest versions on our based-software ensuring our solution
is the best one as of this time.

Limitations
-----------

This is the first attempt to include easy HA configuration in Zentyal.
As it follows a list of known limitations:

* We don't provide any kind of fencing as they have to be manually
configured
* if you require a custom resource configuration, you
will have to use the @pacemaker@ directly to configure using @crm shell@
